#+html: <p align="center"><img src="usingemacs.gif" /></p>

* Install [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][git]] first
* This is a repository for my config files
 Here you can find my
- Emacs configuration
- Custom functions I have written and collected for emacs
- My CS:GO autoexec config
- My git configuration
- My snippets - Usable with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippets]]
- A small script in vbs to start emacs daemon during startup
  completely hiding the console window for windows.
- My zsh shell config
- My shell aliases
- KeyBoard Config for the *K70 RGB* Keyboard

* Setup
Get [[https://www.dropbox.com/downloading][Dropbox]], since agenda file is located in there, emacs will bug you
if it can't find it. After logging in and syncing all you contents set
*DROPBOX_DIR* to point to the root of Dropbox directory.

- For Linux
  - If you have a Linux system good to go install emacs, run the =copy.sh=
    file and take a break when emacs does work for you.

- For windows
  - Move =emacs--daemon.vbs= to the startup folder, this will start
    emacs daemon every-time you start windows.
  - Move =wifi-on-off.vbs= to startup folder, only do this if you have a
    desktop and you are using a wi-fi still and you want to play CS:GO
    with a good ping.
  - Move =setup_msvc2017.vbs= to startup if you want to use Visual
    Studio for *C++* development. This script will make sure VS
    environmental variables are setup and read for scribbling.
  - Install [[http://www.corsair.com/en-us/downloads][CUE]] for managing your keyboard profiles and import
    =K70_CUE2.cuefolder=.


PS: To get to the startup folder on windows open the run window
(Windows button + R) and write =shell:startup=.
