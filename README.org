#+CAPTION: This is how I feel when I tweak my emacs config
#+html: <p align="center"><img src="fluff/usingemacs.gif" /></p>

* Install [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][git]] first
- You have to move =.gitconfig= manually and set appropriate name for
  the machine, this is only done once for that machine anyways.
- If =magit= suddenly stops working on windows, run this on =cmd=

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global credential.helper wincred
  #+END_SRC

* This is a repository for my config files
 Here you can find my
- Emacs configuration
- Custom functions I have written and collected for emacs
- My CS:GO autoexec config
- My git configuration
- My snippets - Usable with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippets]]
- A small script in vbs to start emacs daemon during startup
  completely hiding the console window for windows.
- My zsh shell config
- My shell aliases
- KeyBoard Config for the *K70 RGB* Keyboard

* Setup
Get [[https://www.dropbox.com/downloading][Dropbox]], since agenda file is located in there, emacs will bug you
if it can't find it. After logging in and syncing all you contents set
*DROPBOX_DIR* to point to the root of Dropbox directory.

Since generally some environment varibles are specific to the machine,
edit file:./lisp/machine-specific.el and move it to =~= directory
manually, this is only done once really.

- For Linux
  - If you have a Linux system good to go install emacs, run the =copy.sh=
    file and take a break when emacs does work for you.

- For windows
  - Move =emacs--daemon.vbs= to the startup folder, this will start
    emacs daemon every-time you start windows.
  - Move =wifi-on-off.vbs= to startup folder, only do this if you have a
    desktop and you are using a wi-fi still and you want to play CS:GO
    with a good ping.
  - Install [[http://www.corsair.com/en-us/downloads][CUE]] for managing your keyboard profiles and import
    =K70_CUE2.cuefolder=.
  - Remember the paths in the registry files should be changed to the correct paths before adding them,
    you might even break windows without doing that.
  - To pin emacsclient on the taskbar, run =runemacs.exe=, pin it to taskbar, change properties -> target to =emacsclientw -c=

- For OS X
  - Install [[https://brew.sh][Brew]].
  - Install Aspell from brew using =brew install aspell=
  - Install emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/
  - Run the =copy.sh=


PS: To get to the startup folder on windows open the run window
(Windows button + R) and write =shell:startup=.

* Environment variables to be added
- *DROPBOX_DIR*, should point to the root of Dropbox.

* Other softwares to install

- [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/][Hunspell]]- Try and match this install path
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'exec-path "c:/Program Files (x86)/Hunspell/bin/")

- [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/download.html][ledger-cli]]
- [[https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack][Hack-font]]
- [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el/tree/master/fonts][All the fonts]]

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; On linux this can easily done by calling
  (all-the-icons-install-fonts)
  #+end_src
